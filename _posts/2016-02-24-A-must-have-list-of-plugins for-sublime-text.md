Sublime text, is one of the most if not the most flexible hackable code editor, available for all OS with a huge list of plugins to make it even better.

In this article, we’ll be talking about the indispensable plugins that you need to install if you want to gain a huge amount of time when using sublime text , without too much talking let’s get directly to the list.

**Files handling**

Files handling is an essential part of any project, because we find our selves creating, opening a lot of files and folders.Using the traditional way(opening a file using the openfile dialog or moving the mouse around to do the job) can cost us some time and that is when the following list comes to play :

* [AdvancedNewFile](https://github.com/skuroda/Sublime-AdvancedNewFile) :
	This plugin is excellent for creating folders and files, it can create files even if the parent folder doesn’t exist yet, which is cool and time saver .

* [iOpener](https://github.com/rosshemsley/iOpener) :
	With this plugin we can open files from any location in our computer.

**Color highlighting**

Those plugins are pretty convenient when it comes to picking and choosing colors especially with CSS.

* [Color highlighter](https://github.com/Monnoroch/ColorHighlighter) :
	As the name says, it is a color highlighter so we can write the hex or rgb code for a color and we get an instantly color changing according to the given color code.

* [ColorPicker](https://github.com/weslly/ColorPicker) :
	This is useful when we want to pick a color and we forgot or don’t know exactly its corresponding code.

**HTML-CSS-JS Related**

* [HTML-CSS-JS Prettify](https://github.com/victorporof/Sublime-HTMLPrettify) :
	A plugin for prettifying HTML-CSS-JS.

* [Nettuts+ Fetch](https://github.com/weslly/Nettuts-Fetch) :
	This is useful if we have a defined list of plugins or libraries and we need
	to add them to our current project.
	However, with the appearance of front-end tools like bower and others, handling dependencies is not an issue anymore SO we can ignore this plugin, BUT for the sake of not leaving the code editor i think you may want to keep it around.

**Strings manipulation Related**

* [Case Convertion](https://github.com/jdc0589/CaseConversion) : An awesome plugin to convert strings and switch  cases from camel case to snake case to whatever case you want.
