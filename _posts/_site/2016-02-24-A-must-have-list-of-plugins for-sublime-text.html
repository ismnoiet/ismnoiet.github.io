<p>Sublime text, is one of the most if not the most flexible hackable code editor, available for all OS with a huge list of plugins to make it even better.</p>

<p>In this article, we’ll be talking about the indispensable plugins that you need to install if you want to gain a huge amount of time when using sublime text , without too much talking let’s get directly to the list.</p>

<p><strong>Files handling</strong></p>

<p>Files handling is an essential part of any project, because we find our selves creating, opening a lot of files and folders.Using the traditional way(opening a file using the openfile dialog or moving the mouse around to do the job) can cost us some time and that is when the following list comes to play :</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/skuroda/Sublime-AdvancedNewFile">AdvancedNewFile</a> :
  This plugin is excellent for creating folders and files, it can create files even if the parent folder doesn’t exist yet, which is cool and time saver .</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/rosshemsley/iOpener">iOpener</a> :
  With this plugin we can open files from any location in our computer.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Color highlighting</strong></p>

<p>Those plugins are pretty convenient when it comes to picking and choosing colors especially with CSS.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/Monnoroch/ColorHighlighter">Color highlighter</a> :
  As the name says, it is a color highlighter so we can write the hex or rgb code for a color and we get an instantly color changing according to the given color code.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/weslly/ColorPicker">ColorPicker</a> :
  This is useful when we want to pick a color and we forgot or don’t know exactly its corresponding code.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>HTML-CSS-JS Related</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/victorporof/Sublime-HTMLPrettify">HTML-CSS-JS Prettify</a> :
  A plugin for prettifying HTML-CSS-JS.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/weslly/Nettuts-Fetch">Nettuts+ Fetch</a> :
  This is useful if we have a defined list of plugins or libraries and we need
  to add them to our current project.
  However, with the appearance of front-end tools like bower and others, handling dependencies is not an issue anymore SO we can ignore this plugin, BUT for the sake of not leaving the code editor i think you may want to keep it around.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Strings manipulation Related</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/jdc0589/CaseConversion">Case Convertion</a> : An awesome plugin to convert strings and switch  cases from camel case to snake case to whatever case you want.</li>
